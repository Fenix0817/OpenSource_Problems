## Overview
Here I have my own implementation of matrix class. It can perform some basic arithmetic operations as well as matrix multiplications. It is not an exhaustive implementation and I am open to pull requests to add more functionality. 

## Functionalities Covered
* **Constructor:**
    * Default or Empty Constructor
    * Copy Constructor
    * Move Constructor
    * Constructor to initialize all values of matrix to fixed value
    * Constructor to initialize all values of matrix using a user vector 

* **Functions:**
    * GetDimension(): to get the dimensions of the Matrix.
    * Print(): to print the matrix.
    * IndexAssign(): to change any value of matrix by indexing row and col.
    * Transpose(): to get transpose of matrix.

* **Overloaded Operators of Class:**
    * '=' Copy Assignment operator
    * '=' Move Assignment operator
    * '*' Matrix Multiplication
    * '*' Scalar Multiplication with Matrix
    * '/' Scalar Division with Matrix
    * '+' Matrix Addition
    * '+' Scalar Addition with Matrix
    * '-' Matrix Subtraction
    * '-' Scalar Subtraction with Matrix

* **Overloaded Operators for maintaining Associative Property for:**
    * '*' Scalar Multiplication
    * '+' Scalar Addition
    * '-' Scalar Subtraction

* **Things to Add:**
    * Matrix Division
    * Other Ideas are welcomed as well!!!
