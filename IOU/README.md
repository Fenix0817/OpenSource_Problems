## Overview
[Intersection over union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) also known as the Jaccard index is most commonly used as a metric to see how much a bounding box overlays over another one. This is heavily used in object detection. 
Here I have written a function IOU() to implement the same.
